# Immersive Music Patcher

Forwards MusicType records from [Immersive Music](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16402)
to winning cell and worldspace records. This patcher is effectively a clone of [Acoustic Space Improvements Patcher](https://github.com/aglowinthefield/AcousticSpaceImprovementsPatcher), but for Immersive Music.

## Usage
- Load Immersive Music early and let other mods overwrite
- Add to your Synthesis pipeline using the patcher browser
- If using multiple Synthesis groups, run this patcher in the same group as other patchers that modify cells/worldspaces to ensure changes are merged properly.

The patcher will log which cells/worldspaces it updated. These can be viewed in the Synthesis log files or in the UI itself.

## Reporting Bugs/Issues
Please include the following to help me help you:
- Synthesis log file(s)
- `Plugins.txt`
- Specific cells(s)/record(s) that are problematic
  - xEdit screenshots not required, but appreciated
